Welcome to the Happy Hotel!
 
This is a student project by a team of students at SRH Heidelberg. We called our team Shrimpcocktail.

You can find the game under the same name "Happy Hotel" on itch.io --> [https://mshtk.itch.io/happy-hotel](link). 

We were working with PlasticSCM at first, so we sadly couldn't transfer the revision history. Also, a lot of the graphic assets turned out too big for GitHub or Git LFS, so we are hosting them seperately.
